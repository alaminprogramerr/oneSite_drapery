 DOCUMENTATION  :
====================================================
• Users can log in through oAuth (Google and Microsoft)
• Users can log in with username and password
• Users can log out.
• Users have a profile page.
• Users cannot get to the profile page without being logged in.
• Anyone can visit the “landing” page (logged in or not logged in).
• Users on their profile page can edit the following fields:
   => Email address
   => Password
   => First name
   => Last name
• The API can only be used by a logged-in user (authenticated).
• The API should give an error (such as a JSON error or HTTP error) if an invalid user (not logged in) tries to query it.
• The client uses react with redux
• The server code contains at least one database migration (to handle new profile fields)
It would also be VERY helpful if users can upload/change their profile image.

• The server serves the web client
• The server serves an API that the web client uses (it should use this for updating profile data)
• The database is postgresql or mysql (it currently uses a Heroku postgresql database, I think)





• The project is documented sufficiently to:
• Check out a copy of the code
• Start the client locally
• Start the server locally
• Test all of the points in this checklist (including google/Microsoft/usr&pwd logins; profile editing)
